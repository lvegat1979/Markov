# Markov Algorithm

*  This Algorithm was created using Visual Studio and C# 
*  I created a couple of libraries to centralize the logic.
*  In the client side I'm using .NET Core and Angular 4.0.
*  The results are displayed like table, with angular components consuming WebApi.
*  The start project is <b>WebAppMarkov</b> this must be as an initial project
*  This solution was implemented to find any work in any direction BONUS
*  The information is returning as expected JSon File according the instructions 
*  The solution is using the JSon files 
*  Please give the necessary access to folder ..\MarkovAlgorithm\WebAppMarkov\Files Because I use this files from the file system



# How to use... 

*  Press Markov Results Option in the Left Menu
*  Should be displayed a table with the Algorithm Resolved
*  In the above part of the window are all words from Words.JSon file displayed as checkboxes 
*  After check some input should paint the word in the table marking the word with yellow color. 
*  Added an image in the root of the project to show how it looks Resolved.PNG
